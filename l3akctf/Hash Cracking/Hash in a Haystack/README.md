# Hash in a Haystack

## Description

I split the flag into 5 pieces, hashed each one, and hid them within a text file among many other hashes. Moreover, I used several different obscure hash algorithms and multiple hash iterations to enhance their security. Unless you have a supercomputer or possess arcane hash-cracking magic that can find the needles within the hashstack, there's no possible way for you to find the flag!!! *Evil cackling*.

Use the [Wictionary top 100,000 most frequently-used English words](https://gist.github.com/h3xx/1976236) as the wordlist, and [best64.rule](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hashcat/-/blob/kali/master/rules/best64.rule) as your rule file.

The order of passwords 1-5 in the flag is based on the order of their hashes in ``hashes.txt`` (i.e., the first hash = pass 1, etc.).

Flag format: ``L3AK{pass1_pass2_pass3_pass4_pass5}``
