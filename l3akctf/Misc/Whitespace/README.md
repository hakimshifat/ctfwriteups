## Description

I used [this site](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=3x5&t=) to make some ASCII art to save my super awesome flag, but something happened and all the spaces got deleted and I lost it. Luckily, I do remember that the MD5 hash of my flag was `a7bf5f833c3e4ceff2e006ff801ec16b`, so maybe you can help me.
