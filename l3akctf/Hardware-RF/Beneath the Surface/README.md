## Description

On the surface, this signal is nothing but meaningless noise — a mere whisper of the wind. But dive deeper into this transmission, and a storm begins to take shape, with gray skies gathering on the horizon. Can you navigate through the static and uncover what lurks beneath the surface of the wav — before it’s too late?
