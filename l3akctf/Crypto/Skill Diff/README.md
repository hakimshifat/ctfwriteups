## Description

No B.S. just raw cryptanalysis. There is nothing weird about the web server that you need to investigate, just upload a file, and it will encrypt it as well as the encrypted flag under one key. Please please please do not use the remote until you have a working local solve script. An original sage implementation of the cipher has been provided for your convenience.
