## Description

You have been trying to infiltrate the L3ak office for some time, and your friend just gave you this mysterious snapshot. What information can you glean from it?

For Q4: The format should read "OS, Workstation".

For Q5: This question is asking about "workstations". Based on the names of the computers you have found, which of these apply to this question?

For Q7: You only need to place the hex value one time at the very end of your answer. Example: user1, user2, 0xXXXXX (number of X's not accurate to the answer). These users will be employees.

For Q12: I apologize there is an error in the solution. If you have found the correct answer, swap the last two values and it will be correct.
